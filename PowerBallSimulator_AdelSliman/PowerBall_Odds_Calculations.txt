The PowerBall Lottery:

There are 69 white balls from which you have to pick 5 (in any order)
and 26 red powerballs from which you have to pick 1.

PowerBall Probability Calculation:

5 out of 69 probability for the first white ball.
4 out of 68 probability for the second white ball.
3 out of 67 probability for the third white ball.
2 out of 66 probability for the fourth white ball.
1 out of 65 probability for the fifth white ball.

1 out of 26 probability for the first red ball.

So... this gives us
(5/69) * (4/68) * (3/67) * (2/66) * (1/65) * (1/26) probability of winning:

.000000003422297813023704

OR to put it into odds form, take 1 and divide it by this number:

1 chance in 292,201,338 tries!!!!
